Morphogenesis started as a minimal variant of Rama Hoetzlein's Fluids SPH, cut down from gFluidSurface in gvdb-voxels, 
https://github.com/ramakarl/gvdb-voxels, 
which was in turn developed from Fluids-v3.

## "Master" branch
This is the cut down version of gFluidSurface.
Dependence on gvdb-voxels library has been removed, and CMakeLists.txt has been rewritten.
New output has been written to provide ascii .ply files for viewing in MeshLab.

This code compiles and runs with cmake 3.10, vtk-9.0, and Cuda 11.2 on Ubuntu 20.04 with GTX 980m.
and on Suse Linux cluster with Cuda 9.1 and Tesla P100.

## "Non-Reciprocal" branch
This is the **morphogenesis simulator** (in progress), with 

* viscous flow
* anisotropic fibrous elasticity
* diffusion of heat/chemicals/morphogens
* epi-genetics
* particle automata behaviour

It can used for

* general purpose soft matter simulator
* real-time simulation (depending on model size and hardware)
* biolgical morphogenesis, especially complex mechanical anatomy 
* living tissue simulation (healing, pathology, disease processes)

It is in principle a **differentiable simulator** because gradients are available for all parameters. NB functions to access this have not _yet_ been written as of April 2021.

### Build instructions  
Morphogenesis depends on Cuda-10 or higher, C++11, CCmake, and vtk-9.x.
Scripts are provided to build and install vtk-9.0.1 and Morphogenesis.
These "should" work on individual workstations or GPU clusters.

The scripts call ccmake (cmake ncrurses text-gui, usually available in non-gui environments e.g. clusters).
Press "c" for configure, twice, then "g" for generate the Makefiles.
The script creates the folder "Morphogenesis/build/".
The software is installed to "~/apps/".

If Environment Modules are installed (e.g. on a GPU cluster), then the script installs the modules in "Morphogenesis/src/module" to "~/modules", otherwise it sets the needed environment variables directly.

#### vtk-9

    cd Morphogenesis/src
    bash ./install_scripts/install_vtk-9.0.1.sh
    
    

NB(1) The user must ensure that vtk-9.x is installed _before_ building Morphogenesis.
    
NB(2) It is strongly recommended to use the same c++11 compiler and library for both vtk-9.x and Morphogenesis, to ensure binary ABI compatability.

#### Morphogenesis 

    cd Morphogenesis/src
    bash ./install_scripts/install_morphogenesis.sh 
    
    . install_scripts/set_env.sh
    
Note the "dot space script" syntax is required for set_env.sh .
This runs the script in the current shell, so that it can set the required enviroment variables.

##### Custom installation
See the details of the install scripts and module files, and adapt as needed.


### SLURM for launching batches on a cluster.

To launch a job using a Slurm script : 

    sbatch <path_to_script/scriptname.slurm>
    
e.g.
    cd Morphogenesis/data
    sbatch ../src/slurm/Morphogenesis_test1.slurm

NB SLURM writes stdout and stderr to file : 

    <working_dir>/slurm-<job_no>.out .

To check the queue : 

    squeue -u <userID>


### Executables
Within Non-Reciprocal branch executables (so far) include:

#### "make_demo2"

This is the main way of launching for testing. It reads a file called SpecificationFile.txt in the "demo" directory. 

usage:
    
    make_demo2 <input_folder> <output_folder>

* Input_folder must contain "SpecificationFile.txt", output will be wrtitten to "output_folder_<data_time>".
* If output_folder is not given, the value from SpecificationFile.txt will be used.

SpecificationFile.txt is generated by make_demo (see below), and contains the launch parameters for both make_demo and load_sim (see below).

make_demo_2 generates a fresh model, then runs the simulation. 
Editng SpecificationFile.txt allows all relevant parameters to be controlled in one place.
This makes iteration for development and ebugging faster.


#### "make_demo"
usage:
    
    cd data
    make_demo  num_particles  spacing  x_dim  y_dim  z_dim  demoType  simSpace
    
"demoType" sets individual particle properties in "demo/particles_pos_vel_color100001.csv", especially epigenetic states, from 3D positions.

(0:free falling, 1:remodelling & actuation, 2:diffusion & epigenetics.)
    
"simSpace" sets parameters in "SimParams." , especially gravity, and wavepool actuation.

{0:regression test, 1:Tower(256,128,256), 2:Wave pool(400,200,400), 3:Small dam break(80,60,80), 4:Dual-Wave pool(200,100,30), 5: Microgravity(160,100.160), 6: Morphogenesis small demo(80,50,80) } 
{7: used by make_demo_2 to take params from SpecificationFile.txt}
    
e.g.

    make_demo 125 1  6 6 6  0 5       // free falling
    
    make_demo 120 1  2 2 30  1 5
    make_demo 600 1  4 4 30  1 5      // remodelling & actuation, with fixed, bone, tendon, muscle, elastic, mesenchyme, external actuation
    
    make_demo 2000 1  6 6 30  1 5     //  "" , with reserve particles for growth.
    
    make_demo 400 1  10 10 3  1 5     // diffusion & epigenetics, with reserve particles for growth.
    
    
    make_demo 10000 1  100 10 10  1 1
    make_demo 100000 1  100 10 100  1 1
    make_demo 100000 1  100 100 10  1 1
    make_demo 1000000 1  100 100 100  1 1


#### "check_demo"
usage:

    cd data
    check_demo  simulation_data_folder  output_folder
    
e.g.
    check_demo  demo  check 
    
CPU-only test program to verify the ability to read and re-output models.

#### "SpecfileBatchGenerator"

Generates a batch of /demo_intstiff* folders containing variations on the original SpecificationFile.txt file.
These can then be used with a Slurm script to launch a batch of simulations.

usage: 

    SpecfileBatchGenerator <path_to_folder_containg_example SpecificationFile.txt file>

e.g.

    cd data
    SpecfileBatchGenerator demo


#### "load_sim"
New launch program to load data from files, and run simulation on GPU.

usage:

    cd data
    load_sim  demo  out   num_files   steps_per_file   freeze_steps      
    save_ply(y/n)  save_csv(y/n)  save_vtp(y/n)      debug(y/n)  gene_activity(y/n)  
    remodelling(y/n)
    
    usage: load_sim  simulation_data_folder  output_folder  num_files  steps_per_file  
    freeze_steps save_ply(y/n)  save_csv(y/n)  save_vtp(y/n)  debug(0-5) gene_activity(y/n)  
    remodelling(y/n) 

    debug: 0=full speed, 1=current special output,  2=host cout, 3=device printf, 
    4=SaveUintArray(), 5=save .csv after each kernel.
    
e.g.
    cd data/test
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  10 3 1 y y y
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  10 1 6 n y y
    
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  1000 10 0 n y y y y y         
    
    // NB Now '100' frames per timestep x02-x20 snapshot after each kernel.
    //x91 end of timestep. x00 begining of simulation.
    
    
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  1000 1 10 n y y y n y                
    
    // NB now 'freeze_steps' delay the start of particle movement, 
    //while heal() forms initial bonds.
    
    
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  1000 1 10 n y y y n n
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  1000 1 10 n y y n y y
    
    load_sim ../demo/ ../out/  200 3 1 n n y 1 y y  // Good launch option for profiling
    
    load_sim ../demo_10000_1_100_10_10/ ../out/  100 30 1 n n y
    load_sim ../demo_100000_1_100_100_10/ ../out/  100 30 1 n n y
    load_sim ../demo_1000000_1_100_100_100/ ../out/  100 30 1 n n y
    
    


    
### Viewing with Paraview

The .vtp files output can be viewed in Paraview. 
This allows visualization of all the parameters, and is especially relevant for diffusion of morphogens, epigenetic state, and material properties.

ParaView is a widely used scientific data visualization tool.
ParaView can be downloaded from https://www.paraview.org/

#### NB GPU conflict:
It is advised to exit Paraview before launching Morphogenesis.
Sometimes other runtime errors arrise if Paraview is still running when Morphogenesis is launched.
    
Both Paraview and Morphogenesis will both try to use your GPU. 
This may result in an _"invalid device context"_ or _"There is no device supporting CUDA"_ error.
This seems to happen specifically where the computer suspends while ParaView is open.
If ParaView fails to release the GPU after being shut down, then it may be necessary to reboot.
    
This does not arise where the two programs are run on separate machines, as when Morphogenesis is run on a cluster.
    
#### Loading the data into ParaView:
    load the .vtp file 
    select the file in the pipeline browser
    
    From the top menu bar, select "Filters->Common->Treshold"

    Set Maximum to the number of active particles in the simulation.
    click "Apply" (green button in Properties)
    In the third row of the tool bar, click "zoom to data" icon (four arrows pointing inwards).
    NB this is necessary, when unused particles are stored in one corner of the simulation, 
    with FPARTICLE_ID = UINT_MAX.
    
    In "Coloring" select the model parameter of interest
    Adjust the coloring scale
    
    Set the background colour:
