0) Allocate buffers (might be automatic, check)
    (i)  particles   FELASTIDX, FNERVEIDX, FCONC, FEPIGEN
    (ii) genome
    

1) Initalize correct UID for each particle

2) Initialize Buffer[FELASTIDX],   FNERVEIDX   , FCONC , FEPIGEN

3) UpdateGenome(); //  sends genome to device. // NB need to initialize genome from file, or something.

4) Need script to generate simulations + functions to read them from file. ? what are the available i/o functions ? currently FluidSystem::SavePoints* () 
Also see how files are read in OpenCL-SPH, and how I planned to use Json, Yaml, hdf5 etc...
Probably use a folder with named csv files.
